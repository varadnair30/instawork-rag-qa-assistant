## 🎯 Overview

This system solves a critical QA challenge: **navigating hundreds of manual test cases stored in JSON files**. Instead of manual keyword searches that lack contextual understanding, QA engineers can now ask questions in natural language like:

- *"What tests cover Spanish onboarding?"*
- *"What happens if internet is lost during signup?"*
- *"Show me validation errors during account creation"*

The system retrieves relevant test cases using semantic search and provides AI-generated summaries for quick comprehension.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 **Smart Retrieval**
- **Semantic Search**: Uses sentence transformers to understand query intent, not just keywords
- **Dynamic Query Expansion**: Automatically expands queries (e.g., "don't have" → "without")
- **Adaptive Keyword Boosting**: Context-aware relevance scoring for critical terms (Spanish, offline mode, validation)
- **Multi-Chunk Retrieval**: Each test case is chunked into overview, preconditions, steps, keywords, and metadata for precise matching

### 🤖 **Intelligent Summarization**
- **Two Answer Modes**:
  - **Structured Mode** (Default): Factual test case details + AI-generated summary
  - **LLM Mode (experimental [Future Scope])**: Conversational, context-aware natural language responses
- **Zero-Hallucination Safeguards**: Citation verification, repetition detection, automatic fallback to structured mode
- **Lemmatization-Based Tagging**: Dynamically identifies scenarios (offline, validation) in test steps

### 🛡️ **Production-Ready**
- **100% Local & Free**: No API keys required - runs entirely offline
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if LLM fails
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full transparency into retrieval and generation pipeline

### **High-Level Data Flow**

```
User Query → Query Expansion → Embedding → Vector Search → Aggregation → LLM Generation → Answer
                ↓                  ↓            ↓              ↓              ↓
           NLP Processing    Sentence      ChromaDB      Score Fusion    FLAN-T5-Base
         (spaCy + NLTK)    Transformer    (HNSW Index)   + Boosting    (with Context)
```

### **Component Breakdown**

#### **1. Data Ingestion (`load_test_cases()`)**
```python
def load_test_cases(self) -> None
```
**What it does:**
- Scans the `test_cases/` directory for all `.json` files
- Parses each JSON file and stores in memory dictionary
- Handles encoding errors gracefully with comprehensive logging
- Validates data integrity before processing

**Why it matters:**
- Foundation for the entire RAG pipeline
- Ensures data quality before expensive embedding operations
- Provides error visibility for debugging malformed test cases

---

#### **2. Document Chunking (`chunk_test_case()`)**
```python
def chunk_test_case(self, test_case: Dict, filename: str) -> List[Dict]
```
**What it does:**
Creates **5 semantic chunks** per test case for granular retrieval:

1. **Overview Chunk**: Title + Test Case ID + Section Path + Description
2. **Preconditions Chunk**: Prerequisites and setup requirements
3. **Steps Chunk**: Test steps with expected results
4. **Keywords Chunk**: Extracted concepts (onboarding, validation, Spanish, offline mode)
5. **Metadata Chunk**: Section name, full path, and categorization

**Example Transformation:**
```
Input: TC25977.json (Spanish Onboarding Test)

Output Chunks:
  [1] Overview: "Title: Verify Pro is able to complete onboarding flow without 
                 resume or positions selected in Spanish\nTest Case ID: TC25977..."
  
  [2] Preconditions: "Preconditions: Pro haven't completed onboarding steps before..."
  
  [3] Steps: "Test Steps and Expected Results:\nStep 1: Navigate to signup page\n
              Expected Result 1: Spanish interface displayed\n..."
  
  [4] Keywords: "Concept: User account creation, onboarding, signup\n
                 Feature: Spanish language support, localization\n..."
  
  [5] Metadata: "Section: Onboarding\nTest: Spanish Onboarding Flow"
```

**Why This Chunking Strategy:**
- **Precision Retrieval**: Query about "Spanish onboarding" matches keyword chunk directly
- **Context Preservation**: Each chunk retains source filename for accurate citation
- **Reduced Noise**: LLM receives only relevant sections, not entire 100+ line test case
- **Flexible Matching**: System can match title-level OR step-level queries effectively

**Dynamic Context Enhancement:**
The chunking pipeline also performs **intelligent annotation**:
- Detects negative scenarios: "without resume" → adds "[Scenario: Account creation WITHOUT resume]"
- Identifies offline-related tests: "lose internet" → adds "[Related to: offline mode, connectivity]"
- Tags validation tests: "invalid", "error" → adds "[This test includes error message validation]"
- Extracts language metadata: "Spanish", "English" → adds "[Languages tested: Spanish]"

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
- ❌ **Whole document as single chunk**: Too much noise, poor precision
- ❌ **Sentence-level chunking**: Loses semantic context and relationships
- ✅ **Semantic section chunking**: Balances granularity with context preservation

---

#### **3. Embedding Generation (`create_embeddings()`)**
```python
def create_embeddings(self) -> None
```
**What it does:**
1. Converts each text chunk into a **384-dimensional vector** using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
2. Stores embeddings in ChromaDB with metadata (filename, chunk type)
3. Creates searchable HNSW index for fast similarity queries

**Model Choice: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`**
- **Speed**: 14,000+ sentences/sec on CPU (120x faster than BERT-base)
- **Quality**: 0.83 cosine similarity on STS benchmark
- **Size**: Only 80MB, runs locally without API costs
- **Offline**: No external API calls required

**How Embeddings Work:**
```
Input Text: "Test Spanish onboarding flow without resume upload"
                              ↓
                    Sentence Transformer
                              ↓
Output Vector: [0.23, -0.45, 0.67, ..., 0.12]  (384 dimensions)
```
Semantically similar texts produce vectors close in geometric space (high cosine similarity).

**Why Not OpenAI Embeddings?**
- Requires paid API keys ($0.0001 per 1K tokens)
- Introduces network latency
- Not fully offline-capable
- Trade-off: Slightly lower quality but 100% free and local

---

#### **4. Vector Storage (ChromaDB)**
```python
self.collection.add(
    embeddings=embeddings.tolist(),
    documents=texts,
    metadatas=metadatas,
    ids=ids
)
```

**What it does:**
- In-memory vector database optimized for semantic search
- Uses **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search
- Stores document text + metadata alongside vectors for retrieval

**Why ChromaDB:**
- **Zero Infrastructure**: No external server required (unlike Pinecone/Weaviate)
- **Fast Search**: O(log n) approximate nearest neighbor lookup
- **Python-Native**: Seamless integration, no network overhead
- **Scalability Path**: Easily upgradeable to persistent storage or cloud deployment

**Index Structure:**
```
ChromaDB Collection: "test_cases"
├── ID: "TC25977.json_keywords_0"
│   ├── Embedding: [0.23, -0.45, ..., 0.12]

#### **5. Smart Retrieval Logic (`retrieve()`)**
```python
def retrieve(self, query: str, similarity_threshold: float = 0.3) -> List[Dict]
```

**Multi-Stage Retrieval Pipeline:**

**Stage 1: Dynamic Query Analysis**
```python
doc = nlp(query_lower)  # spaCy NLP pipeline
is_negative_query = any(tok.lemma_ in ["any", "exist", "have", "show"] 
                       for tok in doc if tok.pos_ in {"VERB", "AUX"})
keywords = set([token.lemma_ for token in doc if token.pos_ in {"NOUN", "PROPN", "VERB"}])
```
- **Negative Query Detection**: "Do we have X?" vs. "Show me X" require different thresholds
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extract nouns, proper nouns, and verbs for boosting

**Stage 2: Query Expansion**
```python
expanded_queries = [query]
if "don't have" in query_lower:
    expanded_queries.append(query.replace("don't have", "without"))
if "lose internet" in query_lower:
    expanded_queries.append(query + " offline mode network connectivity")
if "invalid" in query_lower:
    expanded_queries.append(query + " validation error message")
```
- Automatically adds synonyms and related terms
- Improves recall without sacrificing precision

**Stage 3: Vector Similarity Search**
```python
query_embeddings = self.embedding_model.encode(expanded_queries)
query_embedding = np.mean(query_embeddings, axis=0)  # Ensemble embedding
results = self.collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[query_embedding.tolist()],
    n_results=self.top_k * 3  # Retrieve 3x candidates for filtering
)
```
- Uses ensemble of expanded query embeddings
- Retrieves more candidates than needed for subsequent filtering

**Stage 4: Score Aggregation & Boosting**
```python
# Aggregate multiple chunks per test case
for filename, scores in file_scores.items():
    base_score = np.mean(sorted(scores, reverse=True)[:3])  # Top 3 chunks
    
    # Dynamic keyword boost
    doc_lower = doc_text.lower()
    boost = sum(0.05 for kw in keywords if kw in doc_lower)
    
    boosted_score = base_score + boost
```

**Why Aggregate?**
- One test case has 5 chunks → without aggregation, same test appears 5 times
- Average of top-3 chunks provides robust relevance signal
- Deduplicates results while preserving best matches

**Stage 5: Adaptive Filtering**
```python
if is_negative_query:
    min_threshold = 0.55  # Stricter for "Do we have?" queries
    relative_factor = 0.75
else:
    min_threshold = 0.40  # More permissive for direct queries
    relative_factor = 0.65

filtered_results = [r for r in results if r['score'] >= max(relative_threshold, absolute_min)]
```
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Negative queries require higher confidence
- **Relative Filtering**: Only return results within 65-75% of top score
- **Prevents False Positives**: Stops low-quality matches from appearing

**Stage 6: Scenario-Specific Boosting**
```python
# Offline mode boost
offline_triggers = ["lose internet", "no internet", "connection lost", "offline"]
if any(trigger in query_lower for trigger in offline_triggers):
    offline_related_ids = {"TC11076.json", "TC11096.json", "TC11088.json", "TC27696.json"}
    for result in aggregated_results:
        if result["filename"] in offline_related_ids:
            result["score"] += 0.25  # Strong boost for known offline tests
```
- **Domain-Specific Rules**: Manually boost critical test cases for known edge cases
- **Explainable**: Boost amounts logged transparently in retrieval scores
- **Trade-off**: Adds minor manual tuning but dramatically improves accuracy

---

#### **6. Answer Generation**

The system offers two generation modes based on use case requirements:

##### **A. Structured Mode** (`generate_structured_answer()`)
```python
def generate_structured_answer(self, query: str, retrieved_docs: List[Dict]) -> str
```

**What it does:**
1. **Displays Raw Test Case Data First** (Zero Hallucination)
   - Title, section path, preconditions
   - Truncated steps preview (first 2 steps)
   - Relevance scores with keyword boost transparency
   
2. **Adds AI-Generated Summary** (Safe Context Window)
   ```python
   summary_items = []
   for doc in retrieved_docs[:3]:  # Top 3 only to prevent token overflow
       title = tc.get('title', 'Untitled')[:80]  # Truncate long titles
       summary_items.append(f"- {title} [{doc['filename']}]")
   
   summary_prompt = f"""Answer this question using these test cases:
   Q: {query[:100]}
   Tests: {context_text}
   Answer in 2 sentences:"""
   ```

**Example Output:**
```
Found 2 relevant test case(s):

============================================================
1. [TC25977.json] (Relevance: 0.782 [+0.05 keyword boost])
============================================================
📋 Title: Verify Pro is able to complete onboarding flow without resume in Spanish
📁 Path: Smoke Suite / Onboarding
⚙️  Preconditions: Pro haven't completed onboarding steps before...
📝 Steps: 8 steps
   1. Navigate to signup page
   2. Select Spanish from language dropdown

🤖 AI-Generated Summary:
============================================================
These test cases verify the Spanish language onboarding flow, covering scenarios
with and without resume uploads. All critical steps are validated in Spanish.
[Sources: TC25977.json, TC25952.json]
```

**Why This Mode Is Default:**
- **Verifiable**: Users see raw data before AI interpretation
- **Transparent**: Relevance scores and boosts clearly shown
- **Safe**: Truncated context prevents token overflow errors
- **Deterministic**: Same query always returns same structured data

##### **B. LLM Mode (experimental)** (`generate_llm_answer()`)
```python
def generate_llm_answer(self, query: str, retrieved_docs: List[Dict]) -> str
```

**What it does:**
1. **Builds Rich Context with Dynamic Tagging**
   ```python
   keywords_to_tag = {
       "Offline scenario": ["disable internet", "offline", "no network"],
       "Validation scenario": ["invalid", "error", "required"]
   }
   # Lemmatize words for scenario detection
   step_lemmas = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w) for w in step_words]
   ```
   - Uses NLTK lemmatization to detect scenarios (e.g., "validates" → "validate")
   - Tags steps with descriptive phrases: *"This action may occur when the app is offline"*

2. **Strict Context Truncation** (Prevent Hallucination)
   ```python
   max_context_tokens = 400  # Hard limit
   for i, doc in enumerate(retrieved_docs[:3], 1):  # Top 3 only
       token_estimate = len(context.split()) // 1.3
       if total_tokens + token_estimate > max_context_tokens:
           break  # Stop adding more context
   ```

3. **Controlled LLM Generation**
   ```python
   response = self.llm_pipeline(
       prompt,
       max_length=300,
       min_length=30,
       do_sample=False,      # Deterministic output
       num_beams=2,          # Balance quality vs. speed
       early_stopping=True   # Prevent repetition
   )
   ```

4. **Post-Generation Validation**
   - **Repetition Detection**: Checks for looping or meaningless responses
   - **Citation Verification**: Validates all mentioned filenames exist in retrieved docs
   - **Hallucination Detection**: Flags invented test case IDs
   - **Automatic Fallback**: Switches to structured mode if LLM output is unreliable

**Example Output:**
```
Based on the retrieved test cases, the Spanish onboarding flow is validated in 
TC25977.json and TC25952.json. These tests cover account creation both with and 
without resume uploads, ensuring all UI elements display correctly in Spanish. 
The system validates language persistence across all onboarding steps, including 
phone number entry and position selection screens. [Source: TC25977.json]
```

**When LLM Mode Fails Gracefully:**
```python
# Detect repetition
if answer.lower().count(query.lower()) > 2 or len(set(answer.split())) < 20:
    logger.warning("Detected repetition. Falling back to structured mode.")
    return self.generate_structured_answer(query, retrieved_docs)

# Detect hallucination
cited_files = set(re.findall(r"\bTC\d+\.json\b", answer))
invalid_citations = cited_files - valid_files
if invalid_citations:
    logger.warning(f"Hallucination detected: {invalid_citations}")
    return self.generate_structured_answer(query, retrieved_docs)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### **1. Custom RAG Pipeline (No LangChain/LlamaIndex)**

**Decision**: Built a custom retrieval pipeline instead of using frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex.

**Reasoning**:
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Our dataset of hundreds of JSON test cases requires precise step-level truncation, validation-aware boosting, and citation-safe LLM summarization
- **Simplicity & Transparency**: Custom solution avoids unnecessary abstraction layers, making debugging and optimization straightforward
- **Lightweight & Local**: No external dependencies or API calls - fully offline operation
- **Scalability Path**: Easy to integrate vector stores or frameworks later if dataset grows significantly

### **2. Chunking Strategy**

**Decision**: Each test case is split into 5 semantic chunks (overview, preconditions, steps, keywords, metadata).

**Reasoning**:
- **Precision**: Query like "Spanish onboarding" matches keyword chunk directly, not buried in 100+ line test case
- **Context Preservation**: Each chunk retains source filename for accurate citation
- **Flexible Retrieval**: System can match title-level queries OR step-level queries effectively
- **Trade-off**: Increases index size slightly, but dramatically improves retrieval accuracy

### **3. Embedding Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2**

**Decision**: Sentence-BERT model optimized for semantic similarity.

**Reasoning**:
- **Fast**: 120x faster than BERT-base with comparable accuracy
- **Lightweight**: 80MB model, runs on CPU efficiently
- **Semantic Understanding**: Captures meaning, not just keywords (e.g., "account creation" matches "onboarding flow")
- **Offline**: No API calls required

### **4. Vector Store: ChromaDB**

**Decision**: In-memory vector database for embedding storage and retrieval.

**Reasoning**:
- **Simplicity**: No separate server infrastructure required
- **Performance**: Fast cosine similarity search for hundreds of test cases
- **Scalability**: Can easily upgrade to persistent ChromaDB or Pinecone for larger datasets
- **Trade-off**: Non-persistent (embeddings regenerated on startup) - acceptable for current dataset size

### **5. LLM: Google FLAN-T5-Base**

**Decision**: Open-source sequence-to-sequence model for answer generation.

**Reasoning**:
- **Free & Local**: No OpenAI API costs or rate limits
- **Instruction-Tuned**: Follows prompts reliably for summarization tasks
- **Controlled Output**: Generates concise, factual summaries without verbose hallucinations
- **Trade-off**: Less creative than GPT-4, but perfectly suited for structured QA tasks

### **6. Dual Mode System (Structured + LLM)**

**Decision**: Implemented both Structured (default) and LLM modes for answer generation.

**Reasoning**:

**Structured Mode (Default)**:
- **Why Default?**: QA work prioritizes **precision and traceability** over conversational polish
- **Zero Hallucination**: Shows raw test case data first, then adds AI summary
- **Verifiable**: Every answer cites source files explicitly
- **Production-Ready**: Suitable for validation and compliance scenarios

**LLM Mode (Optional)**:
- **Use Case**: Demos, exploratory queries, non-technical users
- **Contextual Reasoning**: Can infer connections between test cases
- **Safeguards**: Citation verification, repetition detection, fallback to structured mode if unreliable
- **Trade-off**: More creative but occasionally over-generalizes

**Why Not LLM-Only?**
> Even with strict prompts, LLMs have inherent unpredictability. For critical QA tasks where any minor deviation could be misleading, deterministic structured output ensures trustworthiness. LLM mode remains available for flexibility without compromising reliability.

### **7. Adaptive Relevance Boosting**

**Decision**: Dynamic keyword boosting and scenario-aware scoring.

**Examples**:
- **Spanish Queries**: +0.05 boost if "Spanish" or "español" detected in test case
- **Offline Scenarios**: +0.25 boost for TC11076, TC11096, TC11088, TC27696 when query mentions "lose internet", "offline", "connection lost"
- **Validation Errors**: Boost test cases with "error", "invalid", "required" when query asks about validation

**Reasoning**:
- **Addresses Embedding Limitations**: Semantic embeddings sometimes miss exact keyword matches
- **Explainable**: Boosts logged transparently in retrieval scores
- **Trade-off**: Adds minor manual tuning but dramatically improves accuracy for known edge cases

## 🚧 Known Limitations & Trade-offs

### **1. Retrieval Precision**

**Issue**: Some queries like *"invalid email validation"* retrieve TC25977 (resume flow) slightly higher than TC26415 (validation-specific).

**Reason**: Embedding model prioritizes keyword overlap ("email") over conceptual similarity ("validation").

**Mitigation**: Implemented validation-aware boosting heuristic. Can be further improved with query-specific rules.

**Trade-off**: Since the embedding model relies on semantic similarity, it slightly penalizes cases that don’t directly use that term — even if they’re conceptually about validation.

Now, either we can leave it like this — which is completely explainable — or we can add a validation-aware boosting heuristic. That means lightly increasing the score for any test case that deals with validation errors, even if it’s not email-specific.

The trade-off is that we’d need to manually define and hardcode that boost logic — so it’s more rule-based than learned.

### **2. LLM Summary Quality**

**Issue**: FLAN-T5-Base sometimes generates brief or repetitive summaries for short test cases.

**Reason**: Open-source model optimized for instruction-following, not creative generation.

**Mitigation**: Structured mode always shows raw test case data as fallback. LLM mode has automatic fallback logic.

**Trade-off**: Using GPT-4 would improve summaries but requires paid API and lacks offline capability.

### **3. Non-Persistent Embeddings**

**Issue**: Embeddings regenerated on every startup (~30 seconds for 100+ test cases).

**Reason**: ChromaDB runs in-memory by default for simplicity.

**Solution**: Can enable persistent ChromaDB storage in production (one-line config change).

**Trade-off**: Current setup prioritizes ease of deployment over startup speed.
